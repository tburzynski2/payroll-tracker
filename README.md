# Employee Payroll Tracker

This web application allows a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story

As a payroll manager, I want an employee payroll tracker so that I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clicking the "Add employee" button presents a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary.
- After adding an employee, the user is prompted to continue or cancel.
- Choosing to continue prompts to add a new employee.
- Choosing to cancel displays the employee data on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.
